<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Umang. I am 19 years old. SHIT. No, I am 20 years old. Damn, my teen years are already gone haha. I am not used to it yet. I am currently pursuing Software Engineering, from DTU (idk if you this college haha). I have lots and lots of hobbies, if i have to name some, I'd say playing volleyball and badminton, sketching, journaling, cycling, skygazing haha. Uhh, some moreee, uhh, listening to music, watching anime. I also play games like chess and clash of clans. Thats most of the things i could think of right now, but i am sure there's maanyy moooreee. I like doing adventwrous stuff, such as cycling 4 in the morning to see the sunrise from a good place ykwim? I dont really like the grays and whites of cities, I am more about green and blues of nature. I have a journal. I have named him Atlas. YES, my journal has a name, because i think of him as a good friend of mine.  This reminds me, i also read books, not alot, but yes, i do read too. 
Uhh, the first book i read was Harry Potter.
"It’s not about how widely you're loved, it’s about how deeply you're loved." 





 </p>

<p> But i watched the movies first, then read it. Ig it was 4 years back when I read it. Then I started reading books like It ends with us, Ugly love, The fault in our stars, I fell in love with hope, etc etc. I am mostly into romantic novels. I love those novels too that dont have a happy ending, but the love was deep and fulfilled somewhere in between, ykwim? 
Uhh, i dont have a particular quote stuck in my head, But But, i remember a quote from The Fault in our stars.</p>
